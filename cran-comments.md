## Resubmission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have

* used R-devel for checking and building the package

* added the meaning of ASOS in the DESCRIPTION

## Test environments
* local Windows install (R-devel)
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci)
* win-builder (on appveyor-ci)

## R CMD check results

R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* This is actually not my first CRAN submission, I also maintain opencage.

* Brooke Anderson reviewed the package for rOpenSci, therefore her role is "rev".

## Release summary
